# Eyes-Tracking-s-Dataset-Generator
The program is to automatically generate the trainging  dataset of Eyes Tracking for Yolov5

In order to efficiently  collect the dataset for eyes tracking by using YOLOv5, 

***Step 1: I use dlib's models, shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2 to detect eye's landmarks.
***Step 2: The extracted landmarks can be transferred into the bunding box in YOLOv5's format using
